$ Originally, to be able to play a map you must place it in the correct folder.                          $
$                                                                                                        $  
$ Two special tools have been created to pack the maps and to install them.                              $
$                                                                                                        $ 
$ Both tools should be installed in the game root directory ( E.g.: C:\Games\kp )                        $
$                                                                                                        $  
$ The maps will be packed to a file with the .kpmap extension and saves to "%GameDir%\Exported maps\"    $
$ and has the same name as the directory of the map.                                                     $
